# The final data story: A look at unequal living burdens through gas prices
Fianl Presentation: [https://preview.shorthand.com/RzNYNKoNqLyRGO2v](url)

This story examines disparities in gas prices, income levels, crime rates, and population distribution across Pittsburgh's ZIP codes, revealing that residents in low-income areas often bear a heavier fuel cost burden than those in high-income neighborhoods.

I present three charts:
- **Figure 1:** Income × Gas Station Density × Gas Price × Top Tier Quality

  Illustrates geographic variations in gas prices and gas station distribution.

- **Figure 2:** Income × Gas Prices × Crime Rate (Magnitude)

  Reveals that lower-income areas tend to have higher gas prices and higher crime rates.

- **Figure 3:** Extreme Comparison Between Highest and Lowest Gas Price Zones

  Analyzes why high-income areas actually have lower gas prices while low-income areas face higher burdens.

## Conclusion
While fuel prices appear driven by market forces, they actually reflect disparities in urban structure and resource allocation, creating living-cost inequality.
Current government subsidies only cover “household energy expenses” and exclude transportation fuels. Therefore, the burden of transportation fuel costs should be incorporated into policy considerations.


# Changes made since Part II
In Part II, my narrative lacked focus, incorporating diverse data points like fuel prices, crime rates, and income levels without a clear direction.

For Part III, I implemented the following adjustments:

- **Clarified the story theme: Living-cost inequality**

  Shifted focus to inequalities within the “fuel prices × income × geographic region” framework, moving beyond mere data presentation.

- **Reduced chart count to enhance narrative impact**

  Cut down from multiple exploratory charts to three key visualizations, each directly advancing the narrative.

- **Added policy context and CTA**

  Highlighted that government energy subsidies cover only household energy, not transportation fuel → Leading to a stronger call to action.

- **Improved visual consistency and readability**

  Standardized colors, labeling conventions, and annotations to enhance reading flow.


## The audience
My audience includes: 
- Local government policymakers in Pittsburgh / Allegheny County
- Administrative officials focused on cost of living, transportation equity, community investment, and inequality issues
- Also includes urban planners, public policy researchers, and decision-makers in the energy and transportation sectors

I aim to use data visualization to demonstrate how fuel price disparities exacerbate living pressures in low-income communities, thereby urging the government to consider transportation fuel as a fundamental cost of living in policy decisions.


## Final design decisions
**Color Selection**

Income is represented using a monochromatic gradient from light to dark, enabling readers to quickly grasp map variations.
Gas stations are depicted in orange (Top Tier) and blue (non-Top Tier), offering neutral yet easily distinguishable colors.
Circle size corresponds to fuel prices/crime rates, aligning with visual intuition.

**Chart Selection Rationale**
- Map: Most effectively displays spatial variations in fuel prices and income.
- Scatterplot: Reveals trend lines between fuel prices and income, alongside crime rates.
- Highlight Scatterplot: Emphasizes contrasts between regions with the highest and lowest fuel prices.

**Narrative Structure**

Progresses from “city map → trends → extreme comparisons” in layers, aligning with human exploration logic. The transitional text between each chart guides readers naturally to understand why the following chart matters.

**Audience-Oriented Language**

Employs terminology familiar to policymakers, such as living-cost inequality, structural burden, underserved neighborhoods, and policy gap.

I used AI to assist with the following tasks:
- Drafting textual content
- Refining narrative structure and word choice

All visualizations, data cleaning, and analytical decision-making are completed independently.

# Final thoughts
I didn't have much time in Part II to complete the shorthand and design more charts, so my Part II appears less substantial. A significant part of this stems from my desire to create numerous charts detailing all findings. 

However, during interviews, when I attempted to show many of the charts I'd made, they were often too numerous or complex, leading to confusion or requiring explanations to understand. 

Ultimately, I refined the charts down to three (one of which reveals additional information through interactivity), narrowing the focus to a single, clear theme through a layered progression.
