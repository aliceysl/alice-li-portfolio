# Oil Prices and Urban Inequality: Exploring Residents' Cost of Living Through Pittsburgh ZIP Codes
> After buying a car, I see the inequality in the city through oil prices

## Narrative Outline
This story begins with my personal experience—starting to pay attention to gas prices after buying my first car—and gradually guides readers through:
1. The striking differences in gas prices across ZIP codes
2. Whether these disparities correlate with housing prices, income levels, crime rates, and demographic composition
3. The existence of communities bearing the double burden of low income and high gas prices
4. What new inequalities emerge when we factor in gas station density and brand (Top-Tier)
5. Finally, concluding from my perspective as a new car owner, I urge readers: “Pay attention to the subtle ways our daily choices quietly shape urban equity.”
