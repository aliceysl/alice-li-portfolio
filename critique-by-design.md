# Critique By Design
# 📘 MakeoverMonday Redesign Project
## NHTSA Vehicle Recalls by Manufacturer
_By Alice Li
Carnegie Mellon University — Telling Stories with Data_

## Step one: the visualization

I selected the visualization **“NHTSA Recalls by Manufacturer”** from MakeoverMonday for redesign.
My reasons for choosing this topic are as follows:
- **High issue importance:** Vehicle recalls are directly linked to road safety.
- **Extensive data coverage:** NHTSA recall data spans over 50 years, from 1966 to 2023.
- **Difficulty comparing brands and defect categories:** While interactive, the original visualization confined information within pie charts.
- **Lack of timeline and contextual information:** Viewers may misunderstand, leading to brand bias or misconceptions.

My goal is to enable users with a single glance to understand:
- Time trends
- Defect types
- Differences between brands
---
## Step two: the critique
I analyzed the original visualization using Stephen Few's evaluation model, focusing on aspects such as “message clarity, comparative capability, design consistency, and authenticity.”
---
### What is the message?

This pie chart primarily shows:
- Which brand has the most recalls
- Clicking reveals the main defect types for that brand's recalls

In other words, it aims to convey both “overall comparison” and “defect classification.”

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
